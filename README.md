An automated virtual assistant designed to streamline the prior authorization process for healthcare providers. Instead of staff spending significant time on hold, navigating complex phone menus, and repeatedly providing patient information to insurance companies, this solution manages the entire call on their behalf.

The agent dials payersâ€™ prior authorization lines, supplies required patient and service details, responds to prompts or representative questions, and securely records authorization outcomes. By reducing manual effort and standardizing information exchange, it helps providers obtain authorizations faster and with fewer errors.

This product is particularly valuable for medical practices, hospitals, and other healthcare organizations looking to:

Free clinical and administrative staff from time-consuming phone calls.

Accelerate patient access to needed treatments and services.

Improve consistency and accuracy in authorization requests.

Maintain a clear record of calls and outcomes for compliance and quality assurance.

The Prior Authorization Call Agent serves as a reliable, always-available administrative partner, enabling healthcare providers to focus more on patient care while reducing operational costs and administrative burden.
